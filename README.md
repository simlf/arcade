# Arcade
The arcade is a project made for learning how to use the OOP paradigm in C++.

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.
To be able to deal with the elements of the gaming plateform at runtime, the graphics libraries and the games are implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.

Each GUI available for the program is used as a shared library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main program.

# How to add a new game or graphic library ?
